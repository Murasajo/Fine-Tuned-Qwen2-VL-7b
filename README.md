# Fine-Tuned-Qwen2-VL-7b
This project involves fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL 7B Instruct model, a vision-language model capable of understanding and generating language-rich outputs based on multimodal inputs (text and images). The goal is to customize the model for specific tasks using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library and Unsloth's fine-tuning framework.
